# Frontend Challenge: Visualizing Sales Data

This example demonstrates how to visualize sales data using a JavaScript/TypeScript charting library. The dataset represents laptop sales by Company X over the last 7 days.

## Live Demo
[Sales Visualization App](https://3-chart.vercel.app/)

## Task Overview

- Use a visualization library (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js, or Recharts) to represent the sales data.
- Choose the chart type that best represents the given dataset (e.g., line chart, bar chart).
- Ensure the visualization is visually appealing and easy to understand.

## Dataset

| Date       | Sales Count |
|------------|-------------|
| 2024-12-10 | 53          |
| 2024-12-11 | 42          |
| 2024-12-12 | 88          |
| 2024-12-13 | 14          |
| 2024-12-14 | 77          |
| 2024-12-15 | 68          |
| 2024-12-16 | 43          |

## How It Works

1. The dataset is fed into a charting library.
2. A suitable chart type, such as a bar chart or line chart, is used to visualize the trends in laptop sales over the 7-day period.
3. The x-axis represents the dates, while the y-axis shows the sales counts.

## Technologies Used

- **React/Next.js**: Framework for building the web application.
- **Charting Library**: For rendering the sales data visualization (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js).
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and better code maintainability.

## Deployment

1. Push the code to a GitHub repository.
2. Deploy the application on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or a similar platform.
3. Test the visualization to ensure it accurately represents the data.
